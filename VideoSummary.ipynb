And if \\nyou've ever gone to use PowerShell,   you may have noticed that there's a little \\nmessage that it shows every time at the top   when you run it that says, \\\"Install the latest \\nPowerShell for new features and improvements.\\\" Now that new version they're talking about \\nis PowerShell Core, it's sometimes called,   also PowerShell 7 is the latest diversion number \\nfor it. And the names are kind of confusing,   so that's one thing I'm gonna explain. \\nNow, one thing you might be wondering   is if they're pushing so hard for you to \\ninstall this latest version, why don't   they just update your version of PowerShell \\nautomatically and give you the latest version? That's another thing I'll explain. Now before \\ngetting into everything, quickly I wanna mention   that I'm not gonna get into the super nitty gritty \\ndetails about all the differences between the two   versions. I'm mostly gonna stick to more higher \\nlevel, major differences, and if you want to look   up all the little details, I'll post a link for \\nthat in the description and mention it later. Alright so now let's get into the seemingly \\ndifferent versions of PowerShell. So you may   have heard several terms, you may have heard \\nWindows PowerShell or also PowerShell Core,   I already mentioned that myself. Also just \\nPowerShell. And the important thing to understand   is all of these do refer to the same \\npiece of software, it's all PowerShell,   just different versions of it, \\ndifferent stages of development. And there is a reason for them having different \\nnames, which I'll go over. So like I touched on,   PowerShell is the general term for the software. \\nSo it's sort of like saying iOS or Android,   you might be talking about a \\nspecific version like iOS 16 or   Android 10, but you can also just \\nbe referring to the whole thing. And at the moment there are seven different \\nmajor versions of PowerShell. The latest being   PowerShell 7. Now as you know, Windows \\nincludes PowerShell when you install it,   it's pre-installed and what you \\nmight not have noticed, though,   you can tell me, is if you go to run \\nPowerShell, it says Windows PowerShell. It doesn't just say PowerShell, and you might \\nthink what's the difference? Is there? Well, yes,   there is a difference and it is significant. \\nYou see PowerShell is not just included with   Windows. It is its own piece of software. If \\nyou went to the GitHub page where Microsoft   posts the source code for the new PowerShell, \\nyou can go and download it and install it onto your computer. But if you do go \\nto install it, it will just show up as   PowerShell, not Windows PowerShell. Windows \\nPowerShell specifically refers to the   install that came with Windows. \\nIt's considered a component   of your Windows installation. Now Windows \\nPowerShell is the same software as PowerShell. It's just an older version, it's a more \\nstable version that Microsoft decided,   \\\"Okay with Windows 10, for example, we're going \\nto include this version of PowerShell,\\\" in this   case version 5.1 is what's included \\nwith Windows 10 and Windows 11. So   if you're running Windows PowerShell, it is just \\nPowerShell 5.1, and that's included with Windows, so they call it Windows PowerShell. But \\nthe important thing to know is it's not   gonna be the very latest version \\nof PowerShell unless in the future,   there's a brand new version of Windows \\nand they decide to include the latest   major version of PowerShell, but at the \\nmoment that's not the case. But why is this? Why keep this separate older version of PowerShell \\nin Windows that you never add features to, and   still promote this newer version of PowerShell? \\nWhy even keep this difference up? Well,   imagine you're a very big company and \\nyou're running some old version of Windows,   like XP, God forbid, and you \\ndecide, \\\"Alright you know what? We're finally gonna bite the bullet and just \\nupgrade all our systems to Windows 11. We're gonna   rewrite our entire infrastructure around Windows \\nand that's going to include a lot of PowerShell   scripts. So when we deploy new computers, it's \\ngonna use a PowerShell script to install all   the software. And we're also gonna teach all \\nof our IT admins the different commands and configurations we want to use, and we're gonna \\nuse PowerShell to do that.\\\" And in such a real   scenario, it's likely that the company does \\nnot exactly care about having all the latest   nice features. They are going to absolutely \\nprioritize the stuff just continuing to work.   If you're putting all these resources \\ninto creating scripts and teaching   your IT how to use PowerShell on \\nthis particular version and then Microsoft goes and creates multiple updates for \\nPowerShell that's all these new major versions   that change things and may break things. \\nWell then that's not very appealing if   every few years you're gonna have to rewrite all \\nyour scripts, and you don't really have a choice   in it. So instead when Microsoft goes to release a \\nmajor version of Windows, like Windows 11, they'll   say, \\\"Okay you know what, we're gonna release \\nPowerShell 5.1 along with Windows and build it in. And then we're also going to support \\nthat specific version of PowerShell,   as long as we support Windows 11, cause we're \\ngonna include it as a component.\\\" And of course,   Microsoft is going to continue to develop \\nPowerShell and add features for the future.   And they'll release that as its own separate \\nsoftware, for people who do happen to want to   have the latest version with the latest features, \\nthey can choose to go and install that themselves. And again, it will be alongside Windows \\nPowerShell, which will stay the same. But   the important thing is even though they're not \\ngonna be adding new features or upgrading anything   major, well, they're still going to support it in \\nterms of creating bug fixes and security updates.   So that way companies that invest a bunch of \\nresources into creating an infrastructure around this version of PowerShell, they know that \\nthey can keep doing that because Microsoft   will keep supporting it. And they don't have \\nto use the newer version that might not work   with what they make. Alright so now we \\ncan get into what the heck PowerShell   Core is. So the first thing \\nyou need to understand is that all the way up to PowerShell version five, it \\nwas written on a software framework called the   .NET framework. And just think of this, like \\nthe underlying architecture of the software,   not gonna get into too many more details \\nthan that. But starting with PowerShell 6,   Microsoft rewrote PowerShell in a new \\nframework or architecture, which was .NET Core. And it's actually technically a \\nsubset of the .NET framework, but not gonna   get into that, it's a new architecture, just \\nthink of it that way. And there were several   improvements. One very notable one is that where \\nPowerShell before could only run on Windows,   now PowerShell 6 and forward, aKA PowerShell \\nCore because they run on .NET Core, those are actually able to run and be installed \\non not just Windows, but also Linux and MacOS   as well. So now PowerShell is completely \\ncross platform and also Microsoft decided to   make PowerShell Core open source. So you can \\ngo and look at the source code on GitHub if   you wanted to. Now, when Microsoft went \\nto release PowerShell 6, they decided \\\"Alright behind the scenes, there are \\nenough major differences with this   and also enough compatibility differences, some \\nthings don't exactly work as they used to with   PowerShell 5. We'd better add something to the \\nname to signify it's a little bit different.   So they decided to call it PowerShell Core 6 \\nbecause it's written on the .NET Core framework. So basically just to let people know \\nthat this is more than a typical   version update. However, all that being said, when \\nthey released PowerShell 7, they decided to just   drop the Core naming scheme and just call it \\nPowerShell again. Or if you want to include   the version name, just PowerShell 7. And a big \\npart of that is when they went from 6 to 7,   they improved a lot of the compatibility issues. So it was a lot easier to get \\nstuff that you were doing on 5   to work with 7. Though, there are some \\ndifferences. So I guess they figured,   \\\"Alright, it's close enough we'll just call \\nPowerShell again.\\\" And just to be totally clear,   it's not like version 6 and 7 had a non-core \\nversion. When they went from version 5 to 6,   they completely changed PowerShell \\nto be on the .NET Core framework, it's not like they had two \\nparallel versions. So in summary,   PowerShell Core is just an alternative name \\nyou can use to refer to versions of PowerShell   that are written on the .NET Core framework, which \\nare at the moment 6 and 7 and also anything going   forward. Now another thing I want to talk \\nabout, because you may have also seen this if you've ever gone to type in PowerShell into \\nthe start menu, you may have seen a result   for something called Windows PowerShell \\nISE come up. And if you open it up,   you can see it as a bunch of these commands on \\nthe right hand side and on the left, that's like   this window where you can type in a bunch of text \\nand below it, it looks like a regular PowerShell window. What is all this about? Well like you \\nmight know, and how I discussed in my other video,   PowerShell is not just the name of the command \\nprompt-like program, it's actually also the   name of an entire scripting language. So \\nyou could write a program in PowerShell.   So just like you might write a program in \\nPython or some other programming language,   you can write it in PowerShell. And then it runs in the PowerShell program, but it's also \\nwritten in the PowerShell language. Anyway,   because you might be writing scripts \\nthat are many, many lines long, not just   typing in individual commands. They created the \\nPowerShell ISE integrated scripting environment,   which basically just gives you a larger space \\nwhere you can type in and create whole script   and also run it as a whole, instead \\nof having to do something silly like putting each individual line of the script   into PowerShell to test it out and \\nrunning it individually. You could   just literally run the whole thing at once, \\nalso debug the script, it's very similar to   an IDE, integrated development environment for \\nother programs. Though one thing to mention is   the PowerShell ISE is only included with the \\nWindows PowerShell, so installed with Windows. If you go to download PowerShell \\nCore, latest version of PowerShell,   it's not gonna include a PowerShell Core ISE. \\nIt's only the one with Windows that has that.   Why is that? I don't know. So some final \\nthoughts, should you actually install   this latest version of PowerShell they keep \\ntelling you to? I mean, yeah, you may as well, there's not really a reason not to. There are \\nplenty of additional features and like I said,   it's under active development, so there will \\ncontinue to be new features. For example,   some of the ones listed on the Microsoft \\narticle about this. It's cross platform,   we already talked about that. \\nIt has improved performance, there's new Cmdlets which are basically \\njust like little bit more advanced commands,   I talked about that in the other video. And \\nthere's new features with the language itself, so   new ways to do different comparisons or \\nwhatever. But there are also plenty of   other differences, including ones \\nthat may make it not compatible if you were to try to run certain scripts in \\nolder versions of PowerShell. For example,   many commandlets and modules were removed. \\nAlso because this is cross platform,   there are some scripts that you might \\nrun on Windows that might not work   on another computer. Obviously, if \\nit was like MacOS or Linux. There's   also a whole bunch of other little technical \\ndifferences that I'm not qualified to explain, so I'll put that link in the \\ndescription if you want to see   the exact article that talks about literally all \\nthe differences, if you are familiar with that   stuff. But hopefully this video still informed \\nyou, maybe you didn't even know about this new   version of PowerShell but now you do, and \\nyou decide, \\\"Hey, I wanna get that too.\\\" If you enjoyed the video, be sure to \\nsmash the like button so hard that   you literally put your hand through the \\nmonitor. And if you wanna keep watching   the next video I'd recommend is that \\none that I mentioned at the beginning,   talking about the differences between \\nregular Command, Prompt and PowerShell. I went into quite a bit more differences in \\ngeneral, not just PowerShell Core, so you can   click on that right there. So thanks so much for\\n\\nwatching guys, and I'll see you in the next video.\"\n",

When they went from version 5 to 6,   they completely changed PowerShell \\nto be on the .NET Core framework, it's not like they had two \\nparallel versions. So in summary,   PowerShell Core is just an alternative name \\nyou can use to refer to versions of PowerShell   that are written on the .NET Core framework, which \\nare at the moment 6 and 7 and also anything going   forward. Now another thing I want to talk \\nabout, because you may have also seen this if you've ever gone to type in PowerShell into \\nthe start menu, you may have seen a result   for something called Windows PowerShell \\nISE come up. And if you open it up,   you can see it as a bunch of these commands on \\nthe right hand side and on the left, that's like   this window where you can type in a bunch of text \\nand below it, it looks like a regular PowerShell window. What is all this about? Well like you \\nmight know, and how I discussed in my other video,   PowerShell is not just the name of the command \\nprompt-like program, it's actually also the   name of an entire scripting language. So \\nyou could write a program in PowerShell.   So just like you might write a program in \\nPython or some other programming language,   you can write it in PowerShell. And then it runs in the PowerShell program, but it's also \\nwritten in the PowerShell language. Anyway,   because you might be writing scripts \\nthat are many, many lines long, not just   typing in individual commands. They created the \\nPowerShell ISE integrated scripting environment,   which basically just gives you a larger space \\nwhere you can type in and create whole script   and also run it as a whole, instead \\nof having to do something silly like putting each individual line of the script   into PowerShell to test it out and \\nrunning it individually. You could   just literally run the whole thing at once, \\nalso debug the script, it's very similar to   an IDE, integrated development environment for \\nother programs. Though one thing to mention is   the PowerShell ISE is only included with the \\nWindows PowerShell, so installed with Windows. If you go to download PowerShell \\nCore, latest version of PowerShell,   it's not gonna include a PowerShell Core ISE. \\nIt's only the one with Windows that has that.   Why is that? I don't know. So some final \\nthoughts, should you actually install   this latest version of PowerShell they keep \\ntelling you to? I mean, yeah, you may as well, there's not really a reason not to. There are \\nplenty of additional features and like I said,   it's under active development, so there will \\ncontinue to be new features. For example,   some of the ones listed on the Microsoft \\narticle about this. It's cross platform,   we already talked about that. \\nIt has improved performance, there's new Cmdlets which are basically \\njust like little bit more advanced commands,   I talked about that in the other video. And \\nthere's new features with the language itself, so   new ways to do different comparisons or \\nwhatever. But there are also plenty of   other differences, including ones \\nthat may make it not compatible if you were to try to run certain scripts in \\nolder versions of PowerShell. For example,   many commandlets and modules were removed. \\nAlso because this is cross platform,   there are some scripts that you might \\nrun on Windows that might not work   on another computer. Obviously, if \\nit was like MacOS or Linux. There's   also a whole bunch of other little technical \\ndifferences that I'm not qualified to explain, so I'll put that link in the \\ndescription if you want to see   the exact article that talks about literally all \\nthe differences, if you are familiar with that   stuff. But hopefully this video still informed \\nyou, maybe you didn't even know about this new   version of PowerShell but now you do, and \\nyou decide, \\\"Hey, I wanna get that too.\\\" If you enjoyed the video, be sure to \\nsmash the like button so hard that   you literally put your hand through the \\nmonitor. And if you wanna keep watching   the next video I'd recommend is that \\none that I mentioned at the beginning,   talking about the differences between \\nregular Command, Prompt and PowerShell. I went into quite a bit more differences in \\ngeneral, not just PowerShell Core, so you can   click on that right there. So thanks so much for\\n\\nwatching guys, and I'll see you in the next video.\\\"\\n\\n\\nCONCISE SUMMARY:\"\n",

      "  \"text\": \"In a previous video, I discussed the \\ndifference between the Command Prompt   and PowerShell in Windows. And if \\nyou've ever gone to use PowerShell,   you may have noticed that there's a little \\nmessage that it shows every time at the top   when you run it that says, \\\"Install the latest \\nPowerShell for new features and improvements.\\\" Now that new version they're talking about \\nis PowerShell Core, it's sometimes called,   also PowerShell 7 is the latest diversion number \\nfor it. And the names are kind of confusing,   so that's one thing I'm gonna explain. \\nNow, one thing you might be wondering   is if they're pushing so hard for you to \\ninstall this latest version, why don't   they just update your version of PowerShell \\nautomatically and give you the latest version? That's another thing I'll explain. Now before \\ngetting into everything, quickly I wanna mention   that I'm not gonna get into the super nitty gritty \\ndetails about all the differences between the two   versions. I'm mostly gonna stick to more higher \\nlevel, major differences, and if you want to look   up all the little details, I'll post a link for \\nthat in the description and mention it later. Alright so now let's get into the seemingly \\ndifferent versions of PowerShell. So you may   have heard several terms, you may have heard \\nWindows PowerShell or also PowerShell Core,   I already mentioned that myself. Also just \\nPowerShell. And the important thing to understand   is all of these do refer to the same \\npiece of software, it's all PowerShell,   just different versions of it, \\ndifferent stages of development. And there is a reason for them having different \\nnames, which I'll go over. So like I touched on,   PowerShell is the general term for the software. \\nSo it's sort of like saying iOS or Android,   you might be talking about a \\nspecific version like iOS 16 or   Android 10, but you can also just \\nbe referring to the whole thing. And at the moment there are seven different \\nmajor versions of PowerShell. The latest being   PowerShell 7. Now as you know, Windows \\nincludes PowerShell when you install it,   it's pre-installed and what you \\nmight not have noticed, though,   you can tell me, is if you go to run \\nPowerShell, it says Windows PowerShell. It doesn't just say PowerShell, and you might \\nthink what's the difference? Is there? Well, yes,   there is a difference and it is significant. \\nYou see PowerShell is not just included with   Windows. It is its own piece of software. If \\nyou went to the GitHub page where Microsoft   posts the source code for the new PowerShell, \\nyou can go and download it and install it onto your computer. But if you do go \\nto install it, it will just show up as   PowerShell, not Windows PowerShell. Windows \\nPowerShell specifically refers to the   install that came with Windows. \\nIt's considered a component   of your Windows installation. Now Windows \\nPowerShell is the same software as PowerShell. It's just an older version, it's a more \\nstable version that Microsoft decided,   \\\"Okay with Windows 10, for example, we're going \\nto include this version of PowerShell,\\\" in this   case version 5.1 is what's included \\nwith Windows 10 and Windows 11. So   if you're running Windows PowerShell, it is just \\nPowerShell 5.1, and that's included with Windows, so they call it Windows PowerShell. But \\nthe important thing to know is it's not   gonna be the very latest version \\nof PowerShell unless in the future,   there's a brand new version of Windows \\nand they decide to include the latest   major version of PowerShell, but at the \\nmoment that's not the case. But why is this? Why keep this separate older version of PowerShell \\nin Windows that you never add features to, and   still promote this newer version of PowerShell? \\nWhy even keep this difference up? Well,   imagine you're a very big company and \\nyou're running some old version of Windows,   like XP, God forbid, and you \\ndecide, \\\"Alright you know what? We're finally gonna bite the bullet and just \\nupgrade all our systems to Windows 11. We're gonna   rewrite our entire infrastructure around Windows \\nand that's going to include a lot of PowerShell   scripts. So when we deploy new computers, it's \\ngonna use a PowerShell script to install all   the software. And we're also gonna teach all \\nof our IT admins the different commands and configurations we want to use, and we're gonna \\nuse PowerShell to do that.\\\" And in such a real   scenario, it's likely that the company does \\nnot exactly care about having all the latest   nice features. They are going to absolutely \\nprioritize the stuff just continuing to work.   If you're putting all these resources \\ninto creating scripts and teaching   your IT how to use PowerShell on \\nthis particular version and then Microsoft goes and creates multiple updates for \\nPowerShell that's all these new major versions   that change things and may break things. \\nWell then that's not very appealing if   every few years you're gonna have to rewrite all \\nyour scripts, and you don't really have a choice   in it. So instead when Microsoft goes to release a \\nmajor version of Windows, like Windows 11, they'll   say, \\\"Okay you know what, we're gonna release \\nPowerShell 5.1 along with Windows and build it in. And then we're also going to support \\nthat specific version of PowerShell,   as long as we support Windows 11, cause we're \\ngonna include it as a component.\\\" And of course,   Microsoft is going to continue to develop \\nPowerShell and add features for the future.   And they'll release that as its own separate \\nsoftware, for people who do happen to want to   have the latest version with the latest features, \\nthey can choose to go and install that themselves. And again, it will be alongside Windows \\nPowerShell, which will stay the same. But   the important thing is even though they're not \\ngonna be adding new features or upgrading anything   major, well, they're still going to support it in \\nterms of creating bug fixes and security updates.   So that way companies that invest a bunch of \\nresources into creating an infrastructure around this version of PowerShell, they know that \\nthey can keep doing that because Microsoft   will keep supporting it. And they don't have \\nto use the newer version that might not work   with what they make. Alright so now we \\ncan get into what the heck PowerShell   Core is. So the first thing \\nyou need to understand is that all the way up to PowerShell version five, it \\nwas written on a software framework called the   .NET framework. And just think of this, like \\nthe underlying architecture of the software,   not gonna get into too many more details \\nthan that. But starting with PowerShell 6,   Microsoft rewrote PowerShell in a new \\nframework or architecture, which was .NET Core. And it's actually technically a \\nsubset of the .NET framework, but not gonna   get into that, it's a new architecture, just \\nthink of it that way. And there were several   improvements. One very notable one is that where \\nPowerShell before could only run on Windows,   now PowerShell 6 and forward, aKA PowerShell \\nCore because they run on .NET Core, those are actually able to run and be installed \\non not just Windows, but also Linux and MacOS   as well. So now PowerShell is completely \\ncross platform and also Microsoft decided to   make PowerShell Core open source. So you can \\ngo and look at the source code on GitHub if   you wanted to. Now, when Microsoft went \\nto release PowerShell 6, they decided \\\"Alright behind the scenes, there are \\nenough major differences with this   and also enough compatibility differences, some \\nthings don't exactly work as they used to with   PowerShell 5. We'd better add something to the \\nname to signify it's a little bit different.   So they decided to call it PowerShell Core 6 \\nbecause it's written on the .NET Core framework. So basically just to let people know \\nthat this is more than a typical   version update. However, all that being said, when \\nthey released PowerShell 7, they decided to just   drop the Core naming scheme and just call it \\nPowerShell again. Or if you want to include   the version name, just PowerShell 7. And a big \\npart of that is when they went from 6 to 7,   they improved a lot of the compatibility issues. So it was a lot easier to get \\nstuff that you were doing on 5   to work with 7. Though, there are some \\ndifferences. So I guess they figured,   \\\"Alright, it's close enough we'll just call \\nPowerShell again.\\\" And just to be totally clear,   it's not like version 6 and 7 had a non-core \\nversion. When they went from version 5 to 6,   they completely changed PowerShell \\nto be on the .NET Core framework, it's not like they had two \\nparallel versions. So in summary,   PowerShell Core is just an alternative name \\nyou can use to refer to versions of PowerShell   that are written on the .NET Core framework, which \\nare at the moment 6 and 7 and also anything going   forward. Now another thing I want to talk \\nabout, because you may have also seen this if you've ever gone to type in PowerShell into \\nthe start menu, you may have seen a result   for something called Windows PowerShell \\nISE come up.

So the first thing \\nyou need to understand is that all the way up to PowerShell version five, it \\nwas written on a software framework called the   .NET framework. And just think of this, like \\nthe underlying architecture of the software,   not gonna get into too many more details \\nthan that. But starting with PowerShell 6,   Microsoft rewrote PowerShell in a new \\nframework or architecture, which was .NET Core. And it's actually technically a \\nsubset of the .NET framework, but not gonna   get into that, it's a new architecture, just \\nthink of it that way. And there were several   improvements. One very notable one is that where \\nPowerShell before could only run on Windows,   now PowerShell 6 and forward, aKA PowerShell \\nCore because they run on .NET Core, those are actually able to run and be installed \\non not just Windows, but also Linux and MacOS   as well. So now PowerShell is completely \\ncross platform and also Microsoft decided to   make PowerShell Core open source. So you can \\ngo and look at the source code on GitHub if   you wanted to. Now, when Microsoft went \\nto release PowerShell 6, they decided \\\"Alright behind the scenes, there are \\nenough major differences with this   and also enough compatibility differences, some \\nthings don't exactly work as they used to with   PowerShell 5. We'd better add something to the \\nname to signify it's a little bit different.   So they decided to call it PowerShell Core 6 \\nbecause it's written on the .NET Core framework. So basically just to let people know \\nthat this is more than a typical   version update. However, all that being said, when \\nthey released PowerShell 7, they decided to just   drop the Core naming scheme and just call it \\nPowerShell again. Or if you want to include   the version name, just PowerShell 7. And a big \\npart of that is when they went from 6 to 7,   they improved a lot of the compatibility issues. So it was a lot easier to get \\nstuff that you were doing on 5   to work with 7. Though, there are some \\ndifferences. So I guess they figured,   \\\"Alright, it's close enough we'll just call \\nPowerShell again.\\\" And just to be totally clear,   it's not like version 6 and 7 had a non-core \\nversion. When they went from version 5 to 6,   they completely changed PowerShell \\nto be on the .NET Core framework, it's not like they had two \\nparallel versions. So in summary,   PowerShell Core is just an alternative name \\nyou can use to refer to versions of PowerShell   that are written on the .NET Core framework, which \\nare at the moment 6 and 7 and also anything going   forward. Now another thing I want to talk \\nabout, because you may have also seen this if you've ever gone to type in PowerShell into \\nthe start menu, you may have seen a result   for something called Windows PowerShell \\nISE come up. And if you open it up,   you can see it as a bunch of these commands on \\nthe right hand side and on the left, that's like   this window where you can type in a bunch of text \\nand below it, it looks like a regular PowerShell window. What is all this about? Well like you \\nmight know, and how I discussed in my other video,   PowerShell is not just the name of the command \\nprompt-like program, it's actually also the   name of an entire scripting language. So \\nyou could write a program in PowerShell.   So just like you might write a program in \\nPython or some other programming language,   you can write it in PowerShell. And then it runs in the PowerShell program, but it's also \\nwritten in the PowerShell language. Anyway,   because you might be writing scripts \\nthat are many, many lines long, not just   typing in individual commands. They created the \\nPowerShell ISE integrated scripting environment,   which basically just gives you a larger space \\nwhere you can type in and create whole script   and also run it as a whole, instead \\nof having to do something silly like putting each individual line of the script   into PowerShell to test it out and \\nrunning it individually. You could   just literally run the whole thing at once, \\nalso debug the script, it's very similar to   an IDE, integrated development environment for \\nother programs. Though one thing to mention is   the PowerShell ISE is only included with the \\nWindows PowerShell, so installed with Windows. If you go to download PowerShell \\nCore, latest version of PowerShell,   it's not gonna include a PowerShell Core ISE. \\nIt's only the one with Windows that has that.   Why is that? I don't know. So some final \\nthoughts, should you actually install   this latest version of PowerShell they keep \\ntelling you to? I mean, yeah, you may as well, there's not really a reason not to. There are \\nplenty of additional features and like I said,   it's under active development, so there will \\ncontinue to be new features. For example,   some of the ones listed on the Microsoft \\narticle about this. It's cross platform,   we already talked about that. \\nIt has improved performance, there's new Cmdlets which are basically \\njust like little bit more advanced commands,   I talked about that in the other video. And \\nthere's new features with the language itself, so   new ways to do different comparisons or \\nwhatever. But there are also plenty of   other differences, including ones \\nthat may make it not compatible if you were to try to run certain scripts in \\nolder versions of PowerShell. For example,   many commandlets and modules were removed. \\nAlso because this is cross platform,   there are some scripts that you might \\nrun on Windows that might not work   on another computer. Obviously, if \\nit was like MacOS or Linux. There's   also a whole bunch of other little technical \\ndifferences that I'm not qualified to explain, so I'll put that link in the \\ndescription if you want to see   the exact article that talks about literally all \\nthe differences, if you are familiar with that   stuff. But hopefully this video still informed \\nyou, maybe you didn't even know about this new   version of PowerShell but now you do, and \\nyou decide, \\\"Hey, I wanna get that too.\\\" If you enjoyed the video, be sure to \\nsmash the like button so hard that   you literally put your hand through the \\nmonitor. And if you wanna keep watching   the next video I'd recommend is that \\none that I mentioned at the beginning,   talking about the differences between \\nregular Command, Prompt and PowerShell. I went into quite a bit more differences in \\ngeneral, not just PowerShell Core, so you can   click on that right there. So thanks so much for\\\"\\n\\n\\nCONCISE SUMMARY:\"\n",
